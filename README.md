## Description
The primary goal of **DIVISIMA** , an _e-commerce site_ is to sell goods online. This project deals with developing an e-commerce website for **Online Product Sale**. 
It provides the user with a _catalog_ of different product available for purchase in the store. In order to facilitate online purchase a shopping cart is provided to the user. 
The system is implemented using a **3-tier approach**, with a backend database, a middle tier of Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and a web browser as the front end client. _This is a project with the objective to develop a basic website where a consumer is provided with a shopping cart application where he can add desirable products in the cart and buy._ The only _limit_ is the customer can buy the products that are available within the state reach; in other words he can't order products which are from other states.
